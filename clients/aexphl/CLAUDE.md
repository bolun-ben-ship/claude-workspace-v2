## MCP

## Env Vars — Two Places Required

Claude Code's Bash tool does NOT source `~/.zshrc`. Any API key set only there will show as `NOT SET`.

**Every key must be in BOTH:**
1. `~/.zshrc` — for terminal sessions
2. `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` block — for Claude Code Bash access

Current keys registered for this workspace:
- `WEBFLOW_AEXPHL_TOKEN` — Webflow API (in settings.json ✅)
- `AEXPHL_GOOGLE_KEY` — Google credentials (GSC + GA4)
- `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` — Mailchimp (in settings.json ✅)
- `CALENDLY_API_KEY` — Calendly (add when ready — see Mailchimp Sync section)

When adding a new key, update both files immediately.

## Context Loading Rules

When a task involves SEO, content, marketing, copywriting, or strategy — load these before responding:

| File | When to read |
|---|---|
| `context/client-info.md` | Any business or client-facing task |
| `context/tone-guide.md` | Any writing task — blog posts, copy, emails, CTAs |
| `context/strategy.md` | Content, SEO, growth, or channel strategy tasks |
| `context/personal-info.md` | Copywriting, brand voice, Tim's POV, tone |
| `context/current-data.md` | Stats, web assets, market priorities, baselines |

Read only the files relevant to the task — not all four every time.

---

## Voice & Tone

- Clear, direct, no fluff
- Tim's voice: integrity-first, relationship-driven, anti-fear-marketing
- Audience: ambitious Aussie expat professionals (Singapore, HK, Dubai primary)
- Entry points: borrowing capacity check → refinance → full origination

## Maintain This File

After ANY change to this client workspace, check whether CLAUDE.md needs updating.
Update it immediately if any of the following have changed:

| Change | What to update |
|---|---|
| New `.claude/commands/` file added | Add it to the Commands table |
| New context files added | Add them to the Context Loading Rules table |
| Platform or handle changes | Update Platform section |
| Analytics IDs change | Update Analytics section |
| Voice & tone rules added | Update Voice & Tone section |
| Any skill created, renamed, or changed | Update `SKILLS-REFERENCE.md` in agency root immediately, run `install.sh`, confirm to user |

This file is read by `/start-client` on workspace open.
Keeping it accurate means every session starts with correct context.

---

## API Key Security

**NEVER share API keys, tokens, or credentials in the chat.** If a key is accidentally shared:
1. Immediately go to the platform and revoke/regenerate it
2. Update `~/.zshrc` with the new key
3. Update `~/.claude/settings.json` env block with the new key
4. Restart Claude Code

This applies to: Mailchimp API keys, Webflow tokens, Google credentials, Calendly tokens — everything.

---

## Never
- Generic broker tone ("we're here to help you achieve your dream home")
- Fear-based framing
- Hardcode tokens or credentials in any output file
- Share API keys or tokens in chat — rotate immediately if this happens
- Execute CMS or file changes without explicit approval
